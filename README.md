This is Todo List Project. I have created this project as a part of The Web Developer Bootcamp course offered by Udemy. 
Here, in the project there are various options in the Todo list:
  a)  Add new task
  b)  Check or Uncheck the task
  c)  Delete the task
  d)  Enable or disable Add new task option.
